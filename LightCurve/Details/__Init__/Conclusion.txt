The time complexity seems just to be O(N), the graph also approves that.


The memory usuage could be more optimized but the main problem is when numpyallclose gets called, the memory usage spikes and reaches its peak.
I am suspecting that the implementation of allclose creates more arrays of the same size as its arguments, which is in our case 780MB.


So if this is critical we could look for an alternative.

Also the bin_hi and bin_lo arrays might not be neccessary to be initialized in here.
